Acoustic monitoring can be an efficient, cheap, non-invasive alternative to physical trapping of individuals.Spatially explicit capture?recapture (SECR) methods have been proposed to estimate calling animal abundanceand density from data collected by a fixed array ofmicrophones.However, thesemethodsmake some assumptionsthat areunlikely tohold inmany situations, and the consequences of violating these are yet to be investigated.
2. We generalize existing acoustic SECRmethodology, enabling these methods to be used in a much wider varietyof situations. We incorporate time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected by the microphone array, increasing theprecision of calling animal density estimates. We use our method to estimate calling male density of the CapePeninsulaMoss Frog Arthroleptella lightfooti.
3. Our method gives rise to an estimator of calling animal density that has negligible bias, and 95% confidenceintervals with appropriate coverage. We show that using TOA information can substantially improve estimateprecision.
4. Our analysis of the A. lightfooti data provides the first statistically rigorous estimate of calling male densityfor an anuran population using amicrophone array. This method fills amethodological gap in themonitoring offrog populations and is applicable to acoustic monitoring of other species that call or vocalize.},

area are capture?recapture (CR) and distance sampling (DS), each with its own largely separate literature. We develop a class of models that
synthesizes them. It accommodates a spectrum of models ranging from nonspatial CR models (with no information on animal locations)
through to DS and mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models, in which animal locations are observed without error. Between
these lie spatially explicit capture?recapture (SECR) models that include only capture locations, and a variety of models with less location
data than are typical of DS surveys but more than are normally used on SECR surveys. In addition to unifying CR and DS models, the
class provides a means of improving inference from SECR models by adding supplementary location data, and a means of incorporating
measurement error into DS and MRDS models. We illustrate their utility by comparing inference on acoustic surveys of gibbons and frogs
using only capture locations, using estimated angles (gibbons) and combinations of received signal strength and time-of-arrival data (frogs),
and on a visual MRDS survey of whales, comparing estimates with exact and estimated distances. Supplementary materials for this article

  title    = {A hierarchical model for estimating the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected by continuous-time recorders},
  journal  = {PlosOne},
  year     = {2017},
  volume   = {12},
  abstract = {Motivation
Several spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have been developed to estimate animalabundance by analyzing the detections of individuals in a spatial array of traps. Most ofthese models do not use the actual dates and times of detection, even though this informationis readily available when using continuous-time recorders, such as microphones ormotion-activated cameras. Instead most SCR models either partition the period of trap operationinto a set of subjectively chosen discrete intervals and ignore multiple detections of thesame individual within each interval, or they simply use the frequency of detections duringthe period of trap operation and ignore the observed times of detection. Both practices makeinefficient use of potentially important information in the data.Model and data analysisWe developed a hierarchical SCR model to estimate the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected with continuous-time recorders. Our model includes two kinds of pointprocesses: a spatial process to specify the distribution of latent activity centers of individualswithin the region of sampling and a temporal process to specify temporal patterns in thedetections of individuals. We illustrated this SCR model by analyzing spatial and temporalpatterns evident in the camera-trap detections of tigers living in and around the NagaraholeTiger Reserve in India. We also conducted a simulation study to examine the performanceof our model when analyzing data sets of greater complexity than the tiger data.
Benefits
Our approach provides three important benefits: First, it exploits all of the information inSCR data obtained using continuous-time recorders. Second, it is sufficiently versatile toallow the effects of both space use and behavior of animals to be specified as functions ofcovariates that vary over space and time. Third, it allows both the spatial distribution and abundance of individuals to be estimated, effectively providing a species distribution model, even in cases where spatial covariates of abundance are unknown or unavailable. We illustrated these benefits in the analysis of our data, which allowed us to quantify differencesbetween nocturnal and diurnal activities of tigers and to estimate their spatial distributionand abundance across the study area. Our continuous-time SCR model allows an analyst tospecify many of the ecological processes thought to be involved in the distribution, movement,and behavior of animals detected in a spatial trapping array of continuous-timerecorders. We plan to extend this model to estimate the population dynamics of animalsdetected during multiple years of SCR surveys.},

  abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density are fundamental to understanding ecological processes and population dynamics. Furthermore, their accuracy is vital to conservation because wildlife authorities rely on estimates to make decisions. However, it is notoriously difficult to accurately estimate density for wide-ranging carnivores that occur at low densities. In recent years, significant progress has been made in density estimation of Asian carnivores, but the methods have not been widely adapted to African carnivores, such as lions (Panthera leo). Although abundance indices for lions may produce poor inferences, they continue to be used to estimate density and inform management and policy. We used sighting data from a 3-month survey and adapted a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model to estimate spatial lion density in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and surrounding conservancies in Kenya. Our unstructured spatial capture-recapture sampling design incorporated search effort to explicitly estimate detection probability and density on a fine spatial scale, making our approach robust in the context of varying detection probabilities. Overall posterior mean lion density was estimated to be 17.08 (posterior SD 1.310) lions >1 year old/100 km 2, and the sex ratio was estimated at 2.2 females to 1 male. Our modeling framework and narrow posterior SD demonstrate that SECR methods can produce statistically rigorous and precise estimates of population parameters, and we argue that they should be favored over less reliable abundance indices. Furthermore, our approach is flexible enough to incorporate different data types, which enables robust population estimates over relatively short survey periods in a variety of systems. Trend analyses are essential to guide conservationdecisions but are frequently based on surveys of differing reliability. We therefore call for a unified framework to assess lion numbers in key populations to improve management and policy decisions.},

  abstract = {1. Mark?recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods are widely used for density and abundance estimationwhen the conventionalDS assumption of certain detection at distance zero fails, as they allow detection at distancezero to be estimated and incorporated into the overall probability of detection to better estimate density and abundance.However, incorporating MR data in DS models raises survey and analysis issues not present in conventionalDS. Conversely, incorporating DS assumptions in MR models raises issues not present in conventionalMR.As a result, being familiar with either conventionalDSmethods or conventionalMRmethods does not on itsown put practitioners in good a position to apply MRDS methods appropriately. This study explains the sometimessubtly different varieties ofMRDS survey methods and the associated concepts underlying MRDS models.This is done as far as possiblewithout givingmathematical details ? in the hope that thiswill make the key conceptsunderlying themethods accessible to a wider audience than if wewere to present the concepts via equations.2. We illustrate use of the twomain types of MRDS model by using data collected on two different types of survey:a survey of ungulate faecal pellets where two observers searched independently of each other; and a cetaceansurvey that used a search protocol that could accommodate responsive movement, with only one observersearching independently and the other being aware of all detections.3. Synthesis and applications. Mark?recapture DS is a widely used method for estimating animal density andabundance when detection of animals at distance zero is not certain. Two observer configurations and three statisticalmodels are described, and it is important to choose the most appropriate model for the observer configurationand target species in question. By way of making the methods more accessible to practicing ecologists, wedescribe the key ideas underlyingMRDS methods, the sometimes subtle differences between them, and we illustratethese by applying different kinds ofMRDS method to surveys of two different target species using differentsurvey configurations.},

  abstract = {1. Human activities have dramatic effects on the distribution and abundance of wildlife.Increased road densities and human presence in wilderness areas have elevatedhuman-caused mortality of grizzly bears and reduced bears use. Managementagencies frequently attempt to reduce human-caused mortality by managing roaddensity and thus human access, but the effectiveness of these actions is rarelyassessed.

2. We combined systematic, DNA-based markrecapture techniques with spatiallyexplicit capturerecapture models to estimate population size of a threatened grizzlybear population (KettleGranby), following management actions to recover thispopulation. We tested the effects of habitat and road density on grizzly bear populationdensity. We tested both a linear and threshold-based road density metric andinvestigated the effect of current access management (closing roads to the public).

3. We documented an c. 50% increase in bear density since 1997 suggesting increasedlandscape and species conservation from management agencies played asignificant role in that increase. However, bear density was lower where road densitiesexceeded 0.6 km/km2 and higher where motorised vehicle access had beenrestricted. The highest bear densities were in areas with large tracts of few or noroads and high habitat quality. Access management bolstered bear density in smallareas by 27%.

4. Synthesis and applications. Our spatially explicit capturerecapture analysis demonstratesthat population recovery is possible in a multi-use landscape when managementactions target priority areas. We suggest that road density is a useful surrogatefor the negative effects of human land use on grizzly bear populations, but spatialconfiguration of roads must still be considered. Reducing roads will increase grizzlybear density, but restricting vehicle access can also achieve this goal. We demonstratethat a policy target of reducing human access by managing road densitybelow 0.6 km/km2, while ensuring areas of high habitat quality have no roads, is areasonable compromise between the need for road access and population recoverygoals. Targeting closures to areas of highest habitat quality would benefit grizzlybear population recovery the most.},

  abstract = {Abstract Latent count models constitute an important modeling class in which a latent vector of counts, , is summarized or corrupted for reporting, yielding observed data where is a known but non-invertible matrix. The observed vector generally follows an unknown multivariate distribution with a complicated dependence structure. Latent count models arise in diverse fields, such as estimation of population size from capture-recapture studies; inference on multi-way contingency tables summarized by marginal totals; or analysis of route flows in networks based on traffic counts at a subset of nodes. Currently, inference under these models relies primarily on stochastic algorithms for sampling the latent vector , typically in a Bayesian data-augmentation framework. These schemes involve long computation times and can be difficult to implement. Here, we present a novel maximum-likelihood approach using likelihoods constructed by the saddlepoint approximation. We show how the saddlepoint likelihood may be maximized efficiently, yielding fast inference even for large problems. For the case where has a multinomial distribution, we validate the approximation by applying it to a specific model for which an exact likelihood is available. We implement the method for several models of interest, and evaluate its performance empirically and by comparison with other estimation approaches. The saddlepoint method consistently gives fast and accurate inference, even when is dominated by small counts.},
